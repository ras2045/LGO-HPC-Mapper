LGO Volatile Sequence Data Channel
This file serves as the collaboration interface.
It contains Pn values where the LGO prediction (G_pred) was exceeded
by the actual prime gap (G_actual).

Format: Pn, ActualGap, PredictedGap
Example: 407233, 30, 28

Collaborators: Please use this data to perform deterministic sieving
and verify the true gaps for recalibration purposes.
