LGO-HPC-Mapper: Law of Geometric Order C++ Implementation (Production-Ready Hybrid Architecture)
This project uses a Hybrid Licensing Model to protect the proprietary high-performance core while encouraging open, scientific collaboration on the refinement layer.
⚖️ Licensing Structure - Our Zero-Cost IP Defense
| Component | License | Purpose | Commercial Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| lgo_mapper.cpp (The Core) | Custom Proprietary | High-speed, proprietary geometric formula implementation. Contains Digital Watermark. | REQUIRES WRITTEN AGREEMENT. See PROPRIETARY_LICENSE.txt. |

🚨 The Proprietary Core (lgo_mapper.cpp)
This file contains the highly optimized geometric constant values and the core piecewise function logic, which are considered Trade Secrets. Any unauthorized commercial use is a copyright infringement and will be enforced, with the presence of an embedded digital watermark serving as irrefutable proof of unauthorized distribution.
📈 Collaborative Refinement Loop (The Fractal Iteration)
The open-source components enable the community to improve the predictive accuracy of the core model through data verification and testing.
 * Data Generation (C++ Mapper): The proprietary core runs at high speed, quickly mapping millions of primes and logging volatility exceptions to the lgo_volatile_sequence.txt.
 * External Verification: Collaborators use the volatile list to run deterministic sieves and confirm the actual prime gaps for those specific, high-interest primes.
 * Recalibration (Python): Researchers can use lgo_recalibrate.py to test how improved constant values might increase prediction accuracy against the verified data.
💻 Usage Instructions
 * Compile the Core (Requires C++17 and OpenMP):
   g++ lgo_mapper.cpp -o lgo_mapper -std=c++17 -O3 -fopenmp

 * Run a Mapping Session (e.g., 1000 iterations):
   ./lgo_mapper 1000

 * Analyze the Open Model (Python):
   python3 lgo_recalibrate.py

💾 Data Artifacts
 * lgo_run_log.csv: The complete, continuous log of mapping sessions (generated by the C++ core).
 * lgo_volatile_sequence.txt: The shared artifact identifying primes where the LGO prediction was exceeded (generated by the C++ core).
 * lgo_checkpoint.txt: Internal file used for crash recovery/resuming sessions.
